# Portfolio v2 - Overview

Portfolio v2 is a developer platform designed to showcase projects, engineering practices, and technical experience. The platform serves as both a professional portfolio and a public knowledge base documenting the development process behind it.

This project is built as a monorepo containing two main applications:

- A portfolio web application
- A documentation platform

The portfolio highlights development work, projects, and technical skills, while the documentation provides insight into architecture decisions, engineering practices, and the technologies used to build the system.

## Project Goals

The primary goals of Portfolio v2 are:

- Provide a professional developer portfolio
- Showcase real-world engineering practices
- Document architectural decisions and development processes
- Demonstrate modern web development technologies
- Serve as a learning and experimentation platform

## Applications

The repository contains two main applications.

### Web Application

The portfolio web application is the public-facing site where visitors can view:

- developer profile
- project showcases
- technical skills
- professional experience

The application is built using modern frontend technologies and focuses on performance, accessibility, and clean design.

### Documentation Platform

The documentation platform provides detailed technical documentation for the project. It explains the architecture, development roadmap, engineering decisions, and implementation details behind the system.

This documentation is intended for developers, recruiters, and anyone interested in understanding the engineering approach used in the project.

## Monorepo Structure

The project follows a monorepo architecture to manage both applications within a single repository.

```
portfolio-v2
│
├── apps
│ ├── web
│ └── docs
```

--- 

This structure allows both applications to share the same repository while remaining independently deployable.

## Deployment

Each application is deployed independently using modern deployment platforms.

- Portfolio application
- Documentation platform

This setup enables independent updates and continuous deployment for both applications.

## Purpose of This Documentation

This documentation serves several purposes:

- explain how the system is built
- document engineering decisions
- provide transparency into the development process
- act as a reference for future improvements

Readers are encouraged to explore the documentation sections to learn more about the architecture, technology stack, and design philosophy behind Portfolio v2.
