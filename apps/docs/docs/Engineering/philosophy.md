# Engineering Philosophy

This document outlines the engineering principles that guide the development of this platform and my personal approach to software development.

The goal is not only to build working software, but to design systems that are maintainable, scalable, and understandable by other developers.

## Documentation First

Clear documentation is essential for maintainable systems.

Whenever possible, architecture decisions, project goals, and development processes are documented before or alongside implementation. This helps ensure that future contributors — including my future self — can understand how and why a system was built.

Documentation also provides transparency into the engineering process.

## Scalable Architecture

Systems should be designed with future growth in mind.

Even small projects benefit from thoughtful structure that allows new features, services, or applications to be added without requiring major refactoring.

The monorepo structure used in this project allows multiple applications to evolve together while maintaining clear boundaries between them.

## Automation

Repetitive tasks should be automated whenever possible.

Automation reduces the risk of human error and improves development efficiency. Examples include:

- automated deployments
- continuous integration
- repository-based workflows
- automated documentation updates

Automation allows developers to focus on solving problems rather than managing repetitive processes.

## Clean and Readable Code

Code should be easy to read and understand.

Readable code improves collaboration and reduces the long-term cost of maintaining software. Emphasis is placed on:

- meaningful naming
- modular components
- separation of concerns
- consistent formatting

A well-structured codebase makes it easier to add features and fix bugs over time.

## Maintainability

Software should be built to evolve.

Maintainability ensures that a system can adapt to changing requirements without becoming difficult to modify. This is achieved through:

- modular architecture
- clear project structure
- documentation
- consistent development practices

The long-term goal is to create systems that remain reliable and understandable as they grow.
