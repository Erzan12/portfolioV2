# ERP Backend API

## Overview

This project involves developing backend APIs for an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system.

The system supports internal business operations by managing employee data, user accounts, roles, permissions, and other organizational information.

## Objectives

The main goals of the system include:

- providing secure authentication
- managing role-based access control
- supporting employee and user management
- enabling scalable API services for ERP modules

## Technology Stack

The backend API is built using:

- NestJS
- Prisma ORM
- PostgreSQL

These technologies provide strong type safety, database abstraction, and scalable backend architecture.

## Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture where each domain is separated into its own module.

Examples include:

- authentication
- user management
- employee records
- role and permission management

This modular structure improves maintainability and allows individual components to evolve independently.

## Key Features

- JWT authentication
- role-based permissions
- relational database schema
- RESTful API endpoints

## Lessons Learned

Working on this system provided valuable experience with:

- designing database schemas
- implementing authentication systems
- structuring modular backend services
- maintaining enterprise-level applications
